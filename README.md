## üèóÔ∏è Database Basics

### Create a Database
```sql
CREATE DATABASE MULTIPLE_JOIN;
USE MULTIPLE_JOIN;
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è DDL (Data Definition Language)

### Create Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE EMPLOYEE (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    fname VARCHAR(100),
    lname VARCHAR(100),
    Age INT,
    emailID VARCHAR(100),
    PhoneNo VARCHAR(20),
    City VARCHAR(100)
);
```

### Alter Table
```sql
ALTER TABLE EMPLOYEE ADD COLUMN department VARCHAR(100);
```

### Drop Table
```sql
DROP TABLE EMPLOYEE;
```

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è DML (Data Manipulation Language)

### Insert Data
```sql
INSERT INTO EMPLOYEE(id, fname, lname, Age, emailID, PhoneNo, City)
VALUES (1, 'Aman', 'Proto', 32, 'aman@gmail.com', '898', 'Delhi');
```

### Update Data
```sql
UPDATE EMPLOYEE
SET Age = 33
WHERE id = 1;
```

### Delete Data
```sql
DELETE FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE id = 1;
```

---

## üîç DQL (Data Query Language)

### Select All Columns
```sql
SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE;
```

### Select Specific Columns
```sql
SELECT fname, City FROM EMPLOYEE;
```

### WHERE Clause
```sql
SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE City = 'Delhi';
```

---

## üîó Joins

### INNER JOIN
```sql
SELECT P.NAME AS ProjectName, E.fname AS Employee
FROM PROJECT P
JOIN EMPLOYEE E ON P.empID = E.id;
```

### LEFT JOIN
```sql
SELECT E.fname, P.NAME
FROM EMPLOYEE E
LEFT JOIN PROJECT P ON E.id = P.empID;
```

### RIGHT JOIN
```sql
SELECT E.fname, P.NAME
FROM EMPLOYEE E
RIGHT JOIN PROJECT P ON E.id = P.empID;
```

### FULL OUTER JOIN (Emulated in MySQL)
```sql
SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE
LEFT JOIN PROJECT ON EMPLOYEE.id = PROJECT.empID
UNION
SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE
RIGHT JOIN PROJECT ON EMPLOYEE.id = PROJECT.empID;
```

---

## üìä Aggregate Functions

### COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM EMPLOYEE;

SELECT AVG(Age) FROM EMPLOYEE;

SELECT MAX(Age), MIN(Age) FROM EMPLOYEE;
```

---

## üîé Filtering and Sorting

### LIKE (Pattern Matching)
```sql
SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE fname LIKE 'A%';
```

### ORDER BY
```sql
SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE
ORDER BY Age DESC;
```

### BETWEEN
```sql
SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE Age BETWEEN 25 AND 40;
```

### IN
```sql
SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE City IN ('Delhi', 'Mumbai');
```

---

## üìö GROUP BY and HAVING

### GROUP BY
```sql
SELECT City, COUNT(*) AS EmployeeCount
FROM EMPLOYEE
GROUP BY City;
```

### HAVING (used after GROUP BY)
```sql
SELECT City, COUNT(*) AS EmployeeCount
FROM EMPLOYEE
GROUP BY City
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

---

## üîÅ Subqueries

### Simple Subquery
```sql
SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE Age > (SELECT AVG(Age) FROM EMPLOYEE);
```

---

## ü™ü Views

### Create View
```sql
CREATE VIEW ProjectDetails AS
SELECT P.NAME, E.fname, C.first_name
FROM PROJECT P
JOIN EMPLOYEE E ON P.empID = E.id
JOIN CLIENT C ON P.clientID = C.id;
```

### Select From View
```sql
SELECT * FROM ProjectDetails;
```

---

## ‚úÖ Example Query

### Get All Project Names with Employee and Client Info
```sql
SELECT P.NAME AS ProjectName, E.fname AS Employee, C.first_name AS Client
FROM PROJECT P
JOIN EMPLOYEE E ON P.empID = E.id
JOIN CLIENT C ON P.clientID = C.id;
```

---

## üß† Tips

- Use `EXPLAIN` to analyze query performance.
- Always back up data before running `DELETE` or `UPDATE` queries.
- Use constraints (`NOT NULL`, `UNIQUE`, `FOREIGN KEY`) to ensure data integrity.
